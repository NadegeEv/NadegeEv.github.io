My doctoral school ([ED GRNE398](https://ed398.sorbonne-universite.fr/fr/index.html)) organized PhD student's day. This is a wonderful opportunity to exchange with other students about our work, and for me, to discover a wide area of research subjects (from hydrogeology to paleontology).

I am proud to share that my talk was awarded as the best 2nd year PhD student talk. It was a pleasure to be able to break down the mathematical barrier to make my subject engaging and understandable for a wider audience.

You can find my slides [here](/slides/JDD-GRNE.pdf).

Thank you to Nadine Maatouk for the picture !
